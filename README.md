# 🌍 Planetary Orbit Simulator (Advanced)

This is a Python simulation of gravitational orbits between multiple celestial bodies (e.g., Sun, Earth, Mars), based on Newtonian physics.

## 🚀 Features
- Multiple planets and stars
- Realistic gravitational physics: \( F = \frac{GMm}{r^2} \)
- Object-oriented design
- Animated orbits with `matplotlib`
- Trail history for visual clarity

## 🧪 Physics Used
- Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
- Vector kinematics for position and velocity updates
- Conservation of momentum and energy observed over time

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Install Python 3
2. Install required libraries:
